title: The Jupyter Book Team Compass
---

This documentation serves as the **Source of Truth** (SoT) for the Jupyter Book community policy and practices.
It also aims to provide resources that facilitate contribution and coordination among team members.

:::{note} Work in progress!
Jupyter Book was recently [incorporated as a Jupyter sub-project](https://github.com/jupyter/enhancement-proposals/pull/123).

It is in its infancy, and this team compass will change rapidly as we set up our ways of working and governance.
:::

## Goals of the Team Compass

The Team Compass should make our organizational policy, structure, and team practices explicit.
It also delegates authority to other groups, processes, and locations.
See the sections below for more information.[^1]

[^1]: A Team Compass is common in the Jupyter ecoystem (e.g., [here is JupyterHub's Team Compass](https://jupyterhub-team-compass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index-team_guides.html)). In fact, Jupyter's governance model will soon [require that sub-projects have their own Team Compass](https://jupyter.org/governance/software_subprojects.html?responsibilities-of-jupyter-subprojects)
