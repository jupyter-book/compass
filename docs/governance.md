# Governance and decision making

This page describes the groups with decision-making authority in the Jupyter Book community.

## Overview

In short, here is the decision making process that we follow:

- All organizational policy is defined in this Team Compass.
- Most day to day decisions are made by [Core Team](#core-team) members.
- Team members are expected to follow inclusive team practices when making decisions, and to actively share information and collaborate with one another.
- Members of the [Steering Council](#steering-council) may vote to break ties if decision making is at an impasse in any part of the organization.

## Sources of Truth

### Team policy

This Team Compass repository is the source of truth for all team policy, unless explicitly delegated elsewhere.

### Code of Conduct

Our Code of Conduct defines acceptable and unacceptable behavior for any individual participating in an Executable Books space (online or in-person).
It also defines mechanisms for reporting violations and processes for dealing with them.

See [](code-of-conduct.md) for more information.
